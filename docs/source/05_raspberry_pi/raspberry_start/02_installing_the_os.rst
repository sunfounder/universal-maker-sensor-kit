Write Raspberry Pi OS to SD Card
========================================

**Step 1**

The Raspberry Pi team offers a user-friendly graphical SD card writing tool compatible with Mac OS, Ubuntu 18.04, and Windows. This is the most convenient option for most users, as it automatically downloads and installs the OS image to the SD card.

Visit the download page: https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/. Choose the **Raspberry Pi Imager** for your operating system. Once downloaded, open it to begin the installation.

**Step 2**

Upon launching the installer, your OS might prompt a security warning. For instance, Windows may show this message:

If you see this warning, click on **More info** and then choose **Run anyway**. Continue by following the instructions on your screen to complete the installation of the Raspberry Pi Imager.


**Step 3**

After installing the Imager, open the application by clicking the **Raspberry Pi Imager** icon or executing ``rpi-imager``.

**Step 6**

Insert your preferred storage medium, such as a microSD card, into an external or integrated SD card reader. Next, click "Choose Storage" and select your device.

.. note:: 

   **Ensure you select the correct storage device when multiple devices are connected**; they can often be distinguished by their capacity. If uncertain, disconnect the other devices. **Be aware that installing the system on the chosen storage device will erase all data on it.**

**Step 8**

Set the **hostname**.

.. note::

   The hostname option defines the hostname your Raspberry Pi broadcasts to the network using mDNS. By connecting your Raspberry Pi to the network, it allows other devices to interact with it using ``<hostname>.local`` or ``<hostname>.lan``.

Set the **username** and **password** for the Raspberry Pi's administrator account.

.. note::
   The Raspberry Pi does not come with a default password, making it crucial to set one. Additionally, you have the option to personalize the username.
