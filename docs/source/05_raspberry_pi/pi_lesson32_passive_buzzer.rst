Lesson 32: Passive Buzzer Module
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to create musical tones using a TonalBuzzer with a Raspberry Pi. You'll learn how to program the Raspberry Pi to play a sequence of musical notes using Python. The lesson includes defining a tune as a list of notes and durations, and writing a function to play these notes through the buzzer. This project offers a straightforward introduction to working with sound output and Python programming, making it a practical choice for beginners interested in exploring musical applications with the Raspberry Pi.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Code
---------------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from gpiozero import TonalBuzzer
   from time import sleep

   # Initialize the TonalBuzzer on GPIO pin 17
   tb = TonalBuzzer(17)  # Change to the pin number your buzzer is connected to

   def play(tune):
      """
      Play a musical tune using the buzzer.
      :param tune: List of tuples, where each tuple contains a note and its duration.
      """
      for note, duration in tune:
         print(note)  # Print the current note being played
         tb.play(note)  # Play the note on the buzzer
         sleep(float(duration))  # Wait for the duration of the note

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Import Libraries
   
   Import ``TonalBuzzer`` from ``gpiozero`` for sound generation and ``sleep`` from ``time`` for timing control.

   .. code-block:: python

      from gpiozero import TonalBuzzer
      from time import sleep

#. Initialize the TonalBuzzer
   
   Create a ``TonalBuzzer`` object connected to GPIO pin 17.

   .. code-block:: python

      tb = TonalBuzzer(17)

#. Define the Play Function
   
   The ``play`` function takes a list of tuples as input, where each tuple represents a musical note and its duration. It iterates through each tuple, playing the note and waiting for its duration.

   .. code-block:: python

      def play(tune):
          for note, duration in tune:
              print(note)
              tb.play(note)
              sleep(float(duration))
          tb.stop()

#. Define the Musical Tune
   
   The tune is defined as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains a note and its duration in seconds. ``None`` is used to represent a pause.

   .. code-block:: python

      tune = [('C#4', 0.2), ('D4', 0.2), (None, 0.2), ...]

#. Play the Tune
   
   The ``play`` function is called with the ``tune`` list, causing the buzzer to play the defined sequence of notes.

   .. code-block:: python

      play(tune)
