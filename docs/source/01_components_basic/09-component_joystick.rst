A joystick module is a device that can measure the movement of a knob in two directions: horizontal (X-axis) and vertical (Y-axis). A joystick module can be used to control various things such as games, robots, cameras, etc.

Specification
---------------------------
* Supply Voltage: 3.3V or 5V
* PCB Size: 34 x 26mm
* Output Signal Type: DO and AO
* Analog Output: X, Y, 2 Axis analog output
* Digital Output: Z, digital output

Pinout
---------------------------
* **+5V**: This is the positive power supply input from the main control. 
* **GND**: Ground connection.
* **VRX**: Analog output. X-axis analog output voltage. Moving the joystick from left to right will cause the output voltage to change from 0 to VCC. When the joystick is in the center position (idle state), it will read about half of VCC.
* **VRY**: Analog output. Y-axis analog output voltage. Moving the joystick up or down will cause the output voltage to change from 0 to VCC. When the joystick is in the center position (at rest), it will read approximately half of VCC.
* **SW**: Digital output. The pushbutton switch outputs a floating signal by default. 

.. tip::
    To read the pushbutton switch, a pull-up resistor is needed. When the joystick knob is pressed, the switch output becomes LOW; otherwise, it remains HIGH. Ensure that the input pin connected to the switch has either internal pull-up enabled or an external pull-up resistor connected.

Principle
---------------------------
Joystick operates based on the resistance change of two potentiometers (usually 10-kilo ohms). By changing resistance in x and y directions, Arduino receives varying voltages which are interpreted to x and y coordinates. The processor needs an ADC unit to change the joystick’s analog values into digital values and perform necessary processing.

Arduino boards have six 10-bits ADC channels. It means the Arduino’s reference voltage (5 volts) is divided to 1024 segments. When joystick moves along the x-axis, the ADC value rises from 0 to 1023, with the value 512 in the middle. The image below displays the ADC approximate value based on the joystick position.
