Lesson 32: Passive Buzzer Module
==================================

In this lesson, you'll learn to play a melody on a passive buzzer module using an ESP32 Development Board. We'll cover programming the ESP32 to control the buzzer and create musical notes with varying durations. This project is ideal for beginners in electronics and programming, providing hands-on experience in sound generation and basic digital sound principles. You'll develop practical skills in utilizing the ESP32 board and integrating simple components like the passive buzzer.

Required Components

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Including the pitches library:

   This library provides the frequency values for various musical notes, allowing you to use musical notation in your code.

   .. code-block:: arduino
       
      #include "pitches.h"

2. Defining constants and arrays:

   * ``buzzerPin`` is the digital pin on the ESP32 Development Board where the buzzer is connected.

   * ``melody[]`` is an array that stores the sequence of notes to be played.

   * ``noteDurations[]`` is an array that stores the duration of each note in the melody.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      const int buzzerPin = 25;
      int melody[] = {
        NOTE_C4, NOTE_G3, NOTE_G3, NOTE_A3, NOTE_G3, 0, NOTE_B3, NOTE_C4
      };
      int noteDurations[] = {
        4, 8, 8, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4
      };

3. Playing the melody:

   * The ``for`` loop iterates over each note in the melody.

   * The ``tone()`` function plays a note on the buzzer for a specific duration.

   * A delay is added between notes to distinguish them.

   * The ``noTone()`` function stops the sound.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      void setup() {
        for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < 8; thisNote++) {
          int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];
          tone(buzzerPin, melody[thisNote], noteDuration);
          int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;
          delay(pauseBetweenNotes);
          noTone(buzzerPin);
        }
      }

4. Empty loop function:

   Since the melody is played only once in the setup, there's no code in the loop function.
