Lesson 20: Temperature, Humidity & Pressure Sensor (BMP280)
====================================================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to measure atmospheric pressure, temperature, and approximate altitude using the BMP280 sensor with an ESP32 Development Board. We will cover interfacing the sensor with the Adafruit BMP280 library and displaying readings on the Serial Monitor. This tutorial is ideal for those seeking to enhance their understanding of environmental sensing and data logging on the ESP32 platform.

Required Components

Code
---------------------------

.. note:: 
   To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for **"Adafruit BMP280"** and install it.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Including Libraries and Initialization. Necessary libraries are included and the BMP280 sensor is initialized for communication using the I2C interface.

   .. note:: 
      To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for **"Adafruit BMP280"** and install it. 

   - Adafruit BMP280 Library: This library provides an easy-to-use interface for the BMP280 sensor, allowing the user to read temperature, pressure, and altitude. 
   - Wire.h: Used for I2C communication.

   .. raw:: html
    
    <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino
    
      #include <Wire.h>
      #include <Adafruit_BMP280.h>
      #define BMP280_ADDRESS 0x76
      Adafruit_BMP280 bmp;  // use I2C interface


2. The ``setup()`` function initializes the Serial communication, checks for the BMP280 sensor, and sets up the sensor with default settings.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
        while (!Serial) delay(100);
        Serial.println(F("BMP280 test"));
        unsigned status;
        status = bmp.begin(BMP280_ADDRESS);
        // ... (rest of the setup code)

3. The ``loop()`` function reads data from the BMP280 sensor for temperature, pressure, and altitude. This data is printed to the Serial Monitor.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        // ... (read and print temperature, pressure, and altitude data)
        delay(2000);  // 2-second delay between readings.
      }
