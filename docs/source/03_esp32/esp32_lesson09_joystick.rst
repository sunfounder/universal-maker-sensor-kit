Lesson 09: Joystick Module
==================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to read values from a joystick module using the ESP32 Development Board. We'll cover measuring the X and Y axis movements of the joystick and interpreting the switch position. By integrating these inputs with the ESP32, you'll gain insights into handling analog and digital signals. This project is perfect for beginners, providing hands-on experience in reading and processing data from interactive hardware components.

Required Components

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Pin Definitions:
   
   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      const int xPin = 27;  //the VRX attach to
      const int yPin = 26;  //the VRY attach to
      const int swPin = 25;  //the SW attach to

   Constants for the joystick pins are defined. ``xPin`` and ``yPin`` are analog pins for the joystick's X and Y axes. ``swPin`` is a digital pin for the joystick's switch.

#. Setup Function:

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      void setup() {
        pinMode(swPin, INPUT_PULLUP);
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

   Initializes ``swPin`` as an input with a pull-up resistor, essential for the switch's functionality. Starts serial communication at 9600 baud.

#. Main Loop:

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      void loop() {
        Serial.print("X: ");
        Serial.print(analogRead(xPin));  // print the value of VRX
        Serial.print("|Y: ");
        Serial.print(analogRead(yPin));  // print the value of VRY
        Serial.print("|Z: ");
        Serial.println(digitalRead(swPin));  // print the value of SW
        delay(50);
      }

   Continuously reads and prints the values from the joystick's axes and switch to the Serial Monitor, with a delay of 50 ms between readings.
