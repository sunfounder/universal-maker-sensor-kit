Lesson 02: Capacitive Soil Moisture Module
============================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to use a capacitive soil moisture sensor with an ESP32 Development Board to read the moisture level of soil. We'll cover connecting the sensor to pin 25, reading its analog value, and interpreting these readings to determine the soil's moisture level. This project is ideal for beginners as it provides hands-on experience in working with sensors and understanding analog input on the ESP32 platform.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Defining the sensor pin:

   This line of code declares a constant integer ``sensorPin`` and assigns it the value of ``25``, which is the pin the sensor is connected to.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int sensorPin = 25;

#. Setup function:

   The ``setup()`` function is executed once when the program starts. It initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate. This setup is necessary for sending data to the serial monitor.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
      }

#. Loop function:

   The ``loop()`` function runs continuously after ``setup()``. It reads the sensor value from pin A0 using ``analogRead()`` and prints this value to the serial monitor. The ``delay(500)`` statement pauses the loop for 500 milliseconds before the next reading, thus controlling the rate of data acquisition.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        Serial.println(analogRead(sensorPin));
        delay(500);
      }
