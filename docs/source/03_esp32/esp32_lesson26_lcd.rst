Lesson 26: I2C LCD 1602
==================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to set up and display messages on a 16x2 Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) with an I2C interface using an ESP32 Development Board. We'll cover initializing the LCD using the LiquidCrystal I2C library, then displaying "Hello world!" and "LCD Tutorial" on two separate lines of the screen. This tutorial is ideal for beginners, offering hands-on experience with LCD interfaces and improving your understanding of output operations in Arduino programming.


Required Components

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. Library Inclusion and LCD Initialization:
   The LiquidCrystal I2C library is included to provide functions and methods for LCD interfacing. Following that, an LCD object is created using the LiquidCrystal_I2C class, specifying the I2C address, number of columns, and number of rows.

   .. note:: 
      To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for **"LiquidCrystal I2C"** and install it.  

   .. code-block:: arduino

      #include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h>
      LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);

2. Setup Function:
   The ``setup()`` function is executed once when the ESP32 Development Board starts. In this function, the LCD is initialized, cleared, and the backlight is turned on. Then, two messages are displayed on the LCD.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        lcd.init();       // initialize the LCD
        lcd.clear();      // clear the LCD display
        lcd.backlight();  // Make sure backlight is on
      
        // Print a message on both lines of the LCD.
        lcd.setCursor(2, 0);  //Set cursor to character 2 on line 0
        lcd.print("Hello world!");
      
        lcd.setCursor(2, 1);  //Move cursor to character 2 on line 1
        lcd.print("LCD Tutorial");
      }
