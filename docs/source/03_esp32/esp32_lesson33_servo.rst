Lesson 33: Servo Motor (SG90)
==================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to control a servo motor with an ESP32 Development Board. We'll cover the process of making the servo motor scan from 0 to 180 degrees and back, giving you hands-on experience in managing servo movements. This project is ideal for those seeking to grasp motor control and the use of pulse width modulation (PWM) in robotics, utilizing the versatile ESP32 board.

Required Components

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Including the Library

   The ESP32Servo library is included to manage servo motor operations.

   .. code-block:: arduino

     #include <ESP32Servo.h>

#. Defining Servo and Pin

   A Servo object is created, and a pin is defined for servo control.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino

     Servo myServo;
     const int servoPin = 25;

#. Setting Pulse Width Limits

   Minimum and maximum pulse widths are defined for servo motion limits.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino

     const int minPulseWidth = 500; // 0.5 ms
     const int maxPulseWidth = 2500; // 2.5 ms

#. Setup Function

   - The servo is attached to the defined pin and its pulse width range is set.
   - The PWM frequency is set to 50Hz, standard for servos.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino

     void setup() {
       myServo.attach(servoPin, minPulseWidth, maxPulseWidth);
       myServo.setPeriodHertz(50);
     }

#. Loop Function

   - Servo rotation is controlled in a loop, moving from 0 to 180 degrees, then back to 0 degrees.
   - ``writeMicroseconds()`` is used to set the servo position based on pulse width.

   .. raw:: html
      
      <br/>

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        // Rotate the servo from 0 to 180 degrees
        for (int angle = 0; angle <= 180; angle++) {
          int pulseWidth = map(angle, 0, 180, minPulseWidth, maxPulseWidth);
          myServo.writeMicroseconds(pulseWidth);
          delay(15);
        }
      
        // Rotate the servo from 180 to 0 degrees
        for (int angle = 180; angle >= 0; angle--) {
          int pulseWidth = map(angle, 0, 180, minPulseWidth, maxPulseWidth);
          myServo.writeMicroseconds(pulseWidth);
          delay(15);
        }
      }
