Lesson 24: Vibration Sensor Module (SW-420)
==============================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to detect vibrations using an ESP32 Development Board and a Vibration Sensor (SW-420). We'll cover reading digital output from the sensor and using conditional statements to display messages on the serial monitor. When the sensor detects vibration, it will display "Detected vibration..."; otherwise, it will output "...". This project provides a practical way to grasp digital inputs and serial communication, making it ideal for electronics and programming beginners.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code Analysis
---------------------------

1. The first line of code is a constant integer declaration for the vibration sensor pin. We use digital pin 25 to read the output from the vibration sensor.

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      const int sensorPin = 25;

2. In the ``setup()`` function, we initialize the serial communication at a baud rate of 9600 to print readings from the vibration sensor to the serial monitor. We also set the vibration sensor pin as an input.

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);         // Start serial communication at 9600 baud rate
        pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);  // Set the sensorPin as an input pin
      }

3. The ``loop()`` function is where we continuously check for any vibrations detected by the sensor. If the sensor detects a vibration, it prints "Detected vibration..." to the serial monitor. If no vibration is detected, it prints "...". The loop repeats every 100 milliseconds.

   .. code-block:: arduino
   
      void loop() {
        if (digitalRead(sensorPin)) {               // Check if there is any vibration detected by the sensor
          Serial.println("Detected vibration...");  // Print "Detected vibration..." if vibration detected
        } 
        else {
          Serial.println("...");  // Print "..." otherwise
        }
        // Add a delay to avoid flooding the serial monitor
        delay(100);
      }
