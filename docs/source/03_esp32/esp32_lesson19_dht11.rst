Lesson 19: Temperature and Humidity Sensor Module (DHT11)
====================================================================

In this lesson, you will learn how to read temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor using an ESP32 Development Board. We'll also cover interpreting these readings and calculating the heat index in both Celsius and Fahrenheit. This project is ideal for beginners in environmental sensing, providing hands-on experience with sensor data acquisition and basic concepts of climate monitoring on the ESP32 platform.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code
---------------------------

.. note:: 
   To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for **"DHT sensor library"** and install it.

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Inclusion of necessary libraries and definition of constants.
   This part of the code includes the DHT sensor library and defines the pin number and sensor type used in this project.

   .. note:: 
      To install the library, use the Arduino Library Manager and search for **"DHT sensor library"** and install it. 

   .. code-block:: arduino
    
      #include <DHT.h>
      #define DHTPIN 25       // Define the pin used to connect the sensor
      #define DHTTYPE DHT11  // Define the sensor type

#. Creation of DHT object.
   Here we create a DHT object using the defined pin number and sensor type.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      DHT dht(DHTPIN, DHTTYPE);  // Create a DHT object

#. This function is executed once when the ESP32 Development Board starts. We initialize the serial communication and the DHT sensor in this function.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
        Serial.println(F("DHT11 test!"));
        dht.begin();  // Initialize the DHT sensor
      }

#. Main loop.
   The ``loop()`` function runs continuously after the setup function. Here, we read the humidity and temperature values, calculate the heat index, and print these values to the serial monitor.  If the sensor read fails (returns NaN), it prints an error message.

   .. note::
    
      The |link_heat_index| is a way to measure how hot it feels outside by combining the air temperature and the humidity. It is also called the "felt air temperature" or "apparent temperature".

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        delay(2000);
        float h = dht.readHumidity();
        float t = dht.readTemperature();
        float f = dht.readTemperature(true);
        if (isnan(h) || isnan(t) || isnan(f)) {
          Serial.println(F("Failed to read from DHT sensor!"));
          return;
        }
        float hif = dht.computeHeatIndex(f, h);
        float hic = dht.computeHeatIndex(t, h, false);
        Serial.print(F("Humidity: "));
        Serial.print(h);
        Serial.print(F("%  Temperature: "));
        Serial.print(t);
        Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
        Serial.print(f);
        Serial.print(F("Â°F  Heat index: "));
        Serial.print(hic);
        Serial.print(F("Â°C "));
        Serial.print(hif);
        Serial.println(F("Â°F"));
      }
