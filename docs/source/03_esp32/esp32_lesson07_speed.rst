Lesson 07: Infrared Speed Sensor Module
==========================================

In this lesson, you'll learn how to use an ESP32 Development Board with a Speed Sensor Module to detect obstructions. We'll see how the sensor sends a high signal when there's an obstruction and a low signal when the path is clear. This project is ideal for those looking to grasp sensor integration and basic input/output operations in a practical setting using the ESP32 platform.

Required Components
--------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Code Analysis
---------------------------

#. Define the sensor pin

   The sensor pin is declared as a constant integer and is assigned pin number 25 of the ESP32.

   .. code-block:: arduino

      const int sensorPin = 25;

#. Setup function

   This function initializes the serial communication at 9600 baud rate and sets the sensorPin as an input.

   .. code-block:: arduino
    
      void setup() {
        Serial.begin(9600);
        pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);
      }

#. Loop function

   The loop function continuously checks the sensor pin's status.
   If the sensor pin reads HIGH, it prints "Obstruction detected" to the Serial Monitor.
   If the sensor pin is LOW, it prints "Unobstructed".

   .. code-block:: arduino

      void loop() {
        if (digitalRead(sensorPin) == HIGH) {
          Serial.println("Obstruction detected");
        } else {
          Serial.println("Unobstructed");
        }
      }

#. More

   If an encoder is mounted on the motor, the rotational speed of the motor can be calculated by counting the number of times an obstruction passes the sensor within a specific period.
